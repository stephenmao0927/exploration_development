#This file contains common configuration options for the two costmaps used in the navigation stack for more details on the parameters in this file, and a full list of the parameters used by the costmaps, please see http://www.ros.org/wiki/costmap_2d

#For this example we'll configure the costmap in voxel-grid mode
map_type: costmap

#Set the tolerance we're willing to have for tf transforms
transform_tolerance: 4.0 # from 2 to 4
# obstacle_range: 3.5
# raytrace_range: 4.0

# footprint: [[-0.127, -0.127], [-0.18, 0.0], [-0.127, 0.127], [0.0, 0.18], [0.127, 0.127], [0.18, 0.0], [0.127, -0.127], [0.0, -0.18]]
# footprint: [ [-0.277, -0.277], [-0.393, 0.0],  [-0.277, 0.277],  [0.0, 0.393], [0.277, 0.277], [0.393, 0.0],  [0.277, -0.277],  [0.0, -0.393]]
#robot_radius: 0.18

# the radius of robot is 0.15m, set the footprint to 0.15m
robot_radius: 0.4
footprint_padding: 0.1

#The cost at which a cell is considered an obstacle when a map is read from the map_server
lethal_cost_threshold: 65

#Configuration for the sensors that the costmap will use to update a map
# observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor
# laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: autokit_laser_link, data_type: LaserScan, topic: /base_scan, marking: true, clearing: true, max_obstacle_height: 20.0, min_obstacle_height: 0.0}

# layer definitions
traversability:
    map_topic: /occupancy_map_local
    subscribe_to_updates: false

inflation:
    inflation_radius: 2.0 
    # from 3 to 2.0
    cost_scaling_factor: 10.0


# both global and local costmap will subscribe to the same topic (/occupancy_map_local) to get the map
# define the traversability layer to get the map from the topic /occupancy_map_local
